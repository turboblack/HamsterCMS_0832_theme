# HamsterCMS 0832 theme

Walking in my shoes

https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS 0832 theme for HamsterCMS adapted for old browsers

![this is what theme looks like](https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS_0832_theme/blob/main/0832.png)

To use a template, create an 0832 folder in the templates folder, paste theme files there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS

http://w10.host

works with both old and new technologies, and backward compatible

Enjoy your use.
